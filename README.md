# Star Bucks Project
This is an classification model which predicts whether a customer will respond to an offer or not.

## Installation
1. Python3.6
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. sklearn
8. re
9. os
10. datetime

## Motivation
The problem is to build a model that predicts whether a customer will respond to an offer or not. 

## Files in the repository
1. data : The dataset file.
2. Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb : Notebook file contaning the exploration and analysis of the work.
3. README.md : The readme file for write-up.

## Summary of the results
This problem is solved in four steps:
Model ranking based on training data accuracy
1. RandomForestClassifier model accuracy: 0.736
2. GradientBoostingClassifier model accuracy: 0.737
3. LogisticRegression model accuracy: 0.725
4. AdaBoost model accuracy: 0.731

Model ranking based on training data F1-score
1. RandomForestClassifier model f1-score: 0.727
2. GradientBoostingClassifier model f1-score: 0.725
3. LogisticRegression model f1-score: 0.718
4. AdaBoost model f1-score: 0.724

Results suggest that the random forest model has the best training data accuracy and F1-score

## Prediction is divided into the following steps
1. Reading Dataset
2. EDA
3. Data pre-processing
4. Feature Selection 
5. Modelling
6. Evaluation

## How to interact with your project?
Here you just need to install python and install the packages that are listed above and open this .ipymb file in your jupyter notebook and just run all cell or just click <b>SHIFT + ENTER</b> to run cell one by one.

## Licensing
This is just for learning.
